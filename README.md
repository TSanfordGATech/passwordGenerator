About this Project: 
This project is my CSS/bootstrap homework assignment. My objective is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based off a specific criteria outlined in my read me and html. 

What I learned from this project: 
- better use of variables 
- how to properly use and call an array
- proper usage of an event listener 

This is the user story: 
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

These are the grading requirements and my objectives:
